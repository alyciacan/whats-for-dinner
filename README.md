# What's for Dinner?

## Project Description
A true foodie experience!

Select a dish type (or opt for a whole meal!), and a random recipe/set of recipes will be displayed. 
"Let's cook" button does not appear until user has selected a recipe type. 
User can clear their selections and start over. 


All that's missing is the complementary microbrew! üçª
